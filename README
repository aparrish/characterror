Characterror
============

A game by Adam Parrish
http://decontextualize.com/projects/characterror

Running the game
----------------

This game requires Java. If you can't use one of the included executable files,
you can run the game from the command line like so:

  $ java -Xms512m -Xmx1024m -jar processing-py.jar game.py

Instructions
------------

Your goal is to complete words by "firing" letters from your magazine on the
right side of the screen onto the end of one of the strings of letters on
the left side of the screen. Longer words will garner exponentially more
points.

Your score is also affected by your multiplier, which increases as you fire
letters and form words. Your multiplier will be reset if you land a letter
that makes a string that can't be the beginning of a valid English word.

When a string turns green, that means it's a valid English word and can now
be "detonated." Detonating a word immediately scores it, and starts a new
string in that slot. Note that green words can also potentially be the
beginning of an even longer valid word!

Strings that form valid words that can't be made longer, or strings that can't
ever form valid English words, will be detonated automatically.

The game keeps track of what words can be formed from the strings currently
on the left side of the screen, and will only ever allow letters in the
magazine that can be the next letter in forming a valid English word. It's
technically impossible to get stuck, though you may find yourself stretching
your vocabulary to its limits.

The game has three modes: 90 second time trial, 4 minute time trial, and 50
character puzzle mode.

Controls:

* UP/DOWN: select which string to fire into
* Z: fire letter
* X: shuffle magazine (will halve your multiplier)
* ENTER: detonate word at selected slot
* ESC: pause/help
