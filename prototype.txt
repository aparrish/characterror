prototype ideas
---------------

the basic idea
==============

so here's the idea. there are N target strings on the screen, and a list of
letters to "shoot" at the target strings. the goal is to shoot the letters at
the target strings in order to make words. the longer the word, the better.

the "shooting letters" are picked from a dictionary based on how likely they
are to complete words currently possible in the target string. one control
shoots a letter to the end of a string; another control "banks" the string,
either scoring the string if it's complete word, or causing the string to
vanish if it's not.

shooting a letter onto the end of a string that results in the string not
being able to form *any* valid word will instantly cause the string to
disappear.

what makes it fun
=================

the fun is all going to come from the algorithm which selects the letters,
which should make it an interesting choice whether to go for the obvious
word completion or for the letter than will help make a longer word.

things to try
=============

* should word length scale score linearly or geometrically?
* should bonus points be awarded for using more rare letters?
* how many target strings? my inclination is to start with few (maybe three),
  then build up to seven or so as difficulty increases.

visual style
============

the "letter ship" is on the right, shooting left onto the target strings.

I'm thinking it looks like a shmup. a retro aesthetic is easiest, but meh?
the mechanics are vaguely similar to your puzzle bobbles, so that's another
direction.

how to prototype
================

* start with four target strings and a basic way to add letters to them.
* build the "letter ship" which has a string of letters, at first randomly
  generated but later taking into account the target strings.
