prototype ideas
---------------

the basic idea
==============

so here's the idea. there are N target strings on the screen, and a list of
letters to "shoot" at the target strings. the goal is to shoot the letters at
the target strings in order to make words. the longer the word, the better.

the "shooting letters" are picked from a dictionary based on how likely they
are to complete words currently possible in the target string. one control
shoots a letter to the end of a string; another control "banks" the string,
either scoring the string if it's complete word, or causing the string to
vanish if it's not.

shooting a letter onto the end of a string that results in the string not
being able to form *any* valid word will instantly cause the string to
disappear.

what makes it fun
=================

the fun is all going to come from the algorithm which selects the letters,
which should make it an interesting choice whether to go for the obvious
word completion or for the letter than will help make a longer word.

things to try
=============

* should word length scale score linearly or geometrically?
* should bonus points be awarded for using more rare letters?
* how many target strings? my inclination is to start with few (maybe three),
  then build up to seven or so as difficulty increases.

visual style
============

the "letter ship" is on the right, shooting left onto the target strings.

I'm thinking it looks like a shmup. a retro aesthetic is easiest, but meh?
the mechanics are vaguely similar to your puzzle bobbles, so that's another
direction.

how to prototype
================

* start with four target strings and a basic way to add letters to them.
* build the "letter ship" which has a string of letters, at first randomly
  generated but later taking into account the target strings.

THE STORY
---------

You are CAPTAIN S. PELLER, starfighter pilot extraordinaire. Your mission:
defeat the KAHRHAK-TERRORS, evil space aliens bent on galactic domination.
Their only weakness: a KAHRHAK will subsume any letter fired into it.
Form an English word, and the KAHRHAK can be detonated, and thereby
destroyed. Beware: adding letters will subdue KAHRHAKS, but they will
gradually grow in strength, and eventually breach your defenses. Stay
sharp, Captain, and spell quick!

CONTROLS
--------

up/down:		select kahrhak
z:					fire letter
right or c:	discard letter (breaks multiplier)
x:					detonate kahrhak (scores if word, breaks multiplier if not)
esc:				menu

SCORING
-------

when you detonate a valid word, or make a word that can't get any longer:
	- 10 points per letter
	- 50 points for q, j, x, z
	- 25 points for v, w, k, f
	- multiplier goes up by 0.1

when detonating an invalid word: multiplier reset
creating an invalid word: multiplier reset
discarding a letter: multiplier cut in half (e.g., 6x -> 3x)
when timer runs out on word: multiplier reset

ANIMATIONS
----------

- single letters move into view from left
